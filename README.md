# Spatial-Clustering-R

![myimage](figures/incidents.jpeg?raw=false)

Hotspot in the context of traffic safety we define as a location whether there are more unsafe incidents occurring than is normal. 

- The road system can be conceptualised as consisting of three components: the environment, the road users and their vehicles (Haddon, 1980; Sayed et al., 1995).

- Different factors within these components will interact in space and time to contribute causally to a given crash that occurs in the system. Spatial patterns of crashes that have occurred within a broader region and time period are therefore realizations of underlying spatial processes, in which crash risk factors related to road environment, road user and vehicles are spatially heterogeneous.

- The areas in which there are frequently occurring crashes represent areas of high crash burden, whereas risky areas are place where there are a higher probability of a crash occurring, relative to the number of opportunities (i.e. road users interacting in that space) for a crash to occur (Fuller and Morency, 2013). Measurements of the number of opportunities for a crash to occur is often referred to as “exposure” and are a fundamental data requirement in analysis of risk. Without exposure data, spatial analysis of where crashes occur will identify areas with a higher probability of a crash, but necessarily a higher risk, since it will not control for the amount of traffic.

- Here we define hotspots as a location where the probability or risk of a crash is much higher than the rest of the study area. 

- The detection of spatial hotspots is both the first step in understanding the spatial processes that contribute towards risky or burdensome locations in a jurisdiction, and a simple method for defining problem areas with minimal data requirements.

- In road safety, there is a distinction between crash burden and crash risk. 
  - The first aim of this paper is to review commonly used methods for detecting spatial hotspots in road safety, including kernel density estimators and local measures of spatial association. 
  - The second aim of this paper is to apply these techniques to a case study of bicycling safety data and compare the results.
